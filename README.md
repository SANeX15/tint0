### What is tint2?

tint2 is a simple panel/taskbar made for modern X window managers. It was specifically made for Openbox but it should also work with other window managers (GNOME, KDE, XFCE etc.). It is based on ttm http://code.google.com/p/ttm/.

### Features

  * Panel with taskbar, system tray, clock and launcher icons;
  * Easy to customize: color/transparency on fonts, icons, borders and backgrounds;
  * Pager like capability: move tasks between workspaces (virtual desktops), switch between workspaces;
  * Multi-monitor capability: create one panel per monitor, showing only the tasks from the current monitor;
  * Customizable mouse events.

### Goals

  * Be unintrusive and light (in terms of memory, CPU and aesthetic);
  * Follow the freedesktop.org specifications;
  * Make certain workflows, such as multi-desktop and multi-monitor, easy to use.
